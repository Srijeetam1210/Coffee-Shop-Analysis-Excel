## Introduction
The analysis was conducted using Excel, leveraging its data processing, cleaning, and visualization capabilities to gain insights into coffee shop sales data. The analysis involved summarizing large datasets, identifying trends, and creating visual dashboards.

## Data Structure
The dataset is organized into the following key components:
- **Transactions Sheet:** Contains raw transactional data, including information such as transaction date, time, store location, product details, and total bill.
- **Pivot Sheet:** Contains summarized data derived from the transaction details using Pivot Tables.
- **Dashboard Sheet:** Designed to present visual summaries of the data through charts and graphs.

## Excel Tools Used

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
To ensure data accuracy and relevance, several data cleaning and transformation steps were performed:
### 1. Removal of Extra Spaces
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed unnecessary spaces from text fields to ensure consistency in the data.

### 2. Addition of Conditional Columns
- **Conditional Columns:** Created new columns based on specific conditions, such as categorizing transactions based on sales volume or product type.

### 3. Creation of New Columns
- **Multiplication of Existing Columns:** Added new columns by multiplying two existing columns, such as calculating total sales by multiplying quantity and unit price.

### 4. Data Transformation
- **Extraction of New Columns:** Transformed the data by extracting new columns from existing ones, such as deriving the hour of the transaction from the timestamp.




### 1. Pivot Tables
Pivot Tables were extensively used to aggregate and summarize the transactional data. Key aspects of the analysis included:
- **Sales by Day:** Pivot Tables were used to analyze sales volume across different days of the week, helping to identify peak business days.
- **Product Category Performance:** Another Pivot Table summarized the total sales and transaction count across various product categories like Coffee, Tea, and Bakery items.

### 2. Slicers
Slicers were integrated into the Pivot Tables to allow dynamic filtering of data. This enabled the analysis to be interactive, allowing users to quickly filter data by different dimensions, such as:
- **Day of the Week**
- **Product Category**
- **Store Location**

### 3. Data Visualization (Dashboards)
Although the Dashboard sheet is currently empty, the plan was to populate it with visual summaries, including:
- **Sales Trends:** Line charts showing sales trends over time.
- **Product Performance:** Bar charts comparing sales across different product categories.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Maps or charts to analyze performance by store location.

### 4. Conditional Formatting
Conditional Formatting was employed to highlight key data points, such as:
- **Top Sales Days:** Automatically highlighting the days with the highest sales.
- **High-Performing Products:** Emphasizing product categories that generated the most revenue.


## Analysis Summary
Through the use of these tools, several key insights were derived:
- **Peak Business Days:** Identified which days of the week were most profitable.
- **Top-Selling Products:** Determined the most popular product categories.
- **Store Performance:** Analyzed how different store locations performed relative to each other.

## Conclusion
Excel's powerful data analysis tools, combined with thorough data cleaning and transformation processes, provided a comprehensive view of the coffee shop's sales data. The interactive and visual nature of the analysis made it easier to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.
